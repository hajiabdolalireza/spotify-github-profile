Vercel change the package the free tier is not enough for our usage. I moved service to self-host at Digital Ocean.

### Recently Played

Render a list of the last tracks you've listened to:

```
<img src="https://spotify-github-profile.kittinanx.com/api/recently-played?uid=YOUR_SPOTIFY_ID" />
```

Embed directly in your README:

```
![Spotify Recently Played](https://<your-app>.vercel.app/api/recently-played?uid=<YOUR_SPOTIFY_USER>&limit=5)
```

Query parameters:

- `uid` or `user` â€“ Spotify user id. If omitted and only one user token exists in Firestore, that user will be used.
- `limit` â€“ number of tracks to display (1â€“10, default 5).

Aliases `/api/recently_played` and `/api/recentlyplayed` redirect to the primary `/api/recently-played` endpoint.

## Running for development locally

To develop locally, you need:

- A fork of this project as your repository
- A Vercel project connected with the forked repository
- A Firebase project with Cloud Firestore setup
- A Spotify developer account

### Setting up Vercel

- [Create a new Vercel project by importing](https://vercel.com/import) the forked project on GitHub

### Setting up Firebase

- Create [a new Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)
- Create a new Cloud Firestore in the project
- Download configuration JSON file from _Project settings_ > _Service accounts_ > _Generate new private key_
- Convert private key content as BASE64
  - You can use Encode/Decode extension in VSCode to do so
  - This key will be used in step explained below

### Setting up Spotify dev

- Login to [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
- Create a new project
- Edit settings to add _Redirect URIs_
  - add `http://localhost:3000/api/callback`

### Running locally

- Install [Vercel command line](https://vercel.com/download) with `npm i -g vercel`
- Create `.env` file at the root of the project 
- Paste your keys in `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_SECRET_ID`, and insert the name of your downloaded JSON file in `FIREBASE`


```sh
BASE_URL='http://localhost:3000/api'
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='____'
SPOTIFY_SECRET_ID='____'
FIREBASE='__BASE64_FIREBASE_JSON_FILE__'
```

- Run `vercel dev`

```sh
$ vercel dev
Vercel CLI 20.1.2 dev (beta) â€” https://vercel.com/feedback
> Ready! Available at http://localhost:3000
```

- Now try to access http://localhost:3000/api/login

### Handy cURL commands

```
curl -i 'https://<app>.vercel.app/api/ping'
curl -i 'https://<app>.vercel.app/api/recently_played?uid=TEST'
curl -i 'https://<app>.vercel.app/api/recently-played?uid=TEST&limit=5'
```

## Troubleshooting

- **404** â€“ verify `vercel.json` rewrites and that the route file is in the deployment output.
- **No logs** â€“ ensure Flask logs to stdout; check Vercel project is not paused; verify requests hit the Python route (try `/api/ping`).
- **Slow/blank images** â€“ check timeouts/retries; GitHub caching via ETag works; try lowering the `limit`.
